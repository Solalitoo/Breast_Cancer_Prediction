# Intro   
This notebook aims to analyze a [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anandhuh/breast-cancer-prediction-accuracy-98-24/input) and give predictions about the diagnosis of further patients using machine learning models. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial in improving treatment outcomes, and this analysis seeks to leverage data-driven approaches to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

# Project Workflow
1. **Basic Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset's structure and key statistics.
   - **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
   - **Label Encoding / Mapping**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format for model compatibility.
3. **Classification Models**: Implement various machine learning models to predict diagnoses:
   - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification.
   - **Decision Tree**: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions.
   - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
4. **Model Validation/Performance**: Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and potential implications for future work.
